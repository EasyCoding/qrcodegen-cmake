# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a vulnerability in the library itself, please report it directly to the upstream.

If you found a vulnerability in our project, feel free to use a build-in GitHub Security reporting feature and open a new security advisory ticket.

We pay maximum attention to all major issues, especially those related to the security of our projects, and review them as quickly as possible.
